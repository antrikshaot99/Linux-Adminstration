Experiment 1


Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab. In each set replace, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6. Create six files with names of 
the form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg and filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories for organizing your files and name the subdirectories friends, family and work. Use a single command to 
create all three subdirectories at the same time. 
Approach- Use the touch command with brace expansion to create the files and the mkdir command with space-separated names to create the directories.
